## Introduction

Welcome to the Magento 2 Plugin by Convert Cart. This plugin integrates seamlessly with Magento 2 ecommerce websites, enabling the tracking of user behavior. Additionally, it synchronizes crucial data such as product catalogs, order histories, customer profiles, and category information to our servers on a regular basis. This synchronization powers our recommendation engine, providing personalized and data-driven insights to enhance your ecommerce operations.

## Features

- Script injection on the frontend for user behavior tracking.
- Token generation for synchronizing product/order/customer/category data to Convert Cart servers for recommendations.
- Product deletion tracking to avoid recommending deleted products to the visitors of the store.
